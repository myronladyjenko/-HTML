Linear algebra is a branch of algebra that studies objects of linear nature: vector (or linear) spaces, linear mappings, systems of linear equations, among the basic tools used in linear algebra are determinants, matrices, conjugation. Invariant theory and tensor calculus are usually (in whole or in part) also regarded as constituent parts of linear algebra. Objects such as quadratic and bilinear forms, tensors and operations as tensor product directly follow from the study of linear spaces, but as such relate to multilinear algebra. </p>
