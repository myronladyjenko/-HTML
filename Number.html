    <p> Number theory or higher arithmetic is a branch of mathematics that originally studied the properties of integers. </p>
    <p> In modern number theory, other types of numbers are also considered - for example, algebraic and transcendental ones, as well as functions of various origins that are associated with the arithmetic of integers and their generalizations.
In research on number theory, along with arithmetic and algebra, geometric and analytical methods are used, as well as methods of probability theory. Methods of number theory are widely used in cryptography, computational mathematics, computer science. </p>

    <p> A little about the history of the origin. In ancient Egypt, mathematical operations were performed on whole numbers and aliquots. Mathematical papyri contain problems with solutions and auxiliary tables. An even wider use of tables is characteristic of Babylon, who, following the Sumerians, used the sixagesimal number system. Babylonian cuneiform mathematical texts include multiplication tables and reciprocals, squares and cubes of natural numbers. In Babylon, they knew many Pythagorean triplets, for the search for which they probably used an unknown general method. The Pythagoreans, Euclid and Diophantus made a significant contribution to the formation of number theory. The Pythagoreans considered only positive integers and considered the number to be a collection of ones. The units were indivisible and were located in the form of regular geometric bodies. The Pythagoreans are characterized by the definition of "curly numbers" ("triangular", "square" and others). Studying the properties of numbers, they divided them into even and odd, simple and composite. The famous divisibility theory appeared in 399 BC. e. and belongs, apparently, to Theetetus. Euclid dedicated to her Book VII of the Beginnings and part of Book IX. The theory is based on Euclid's algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. A consequence of the algorithm is the possibility of decomposing any number into prime factors, as well as the uniqueness of such an decomposition. The uniqueness law of prime factorization is the basis of integer arithmetic. </p>
