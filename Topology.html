    <p >Topology is a branch of mathematics that studies in its most general form the phenomenon of continuity, in particular, the properties of space that remain unchanged under continuous deformations, for example, connectivity, orientability. Unlike geometry, topology does not consider the metric properties of objects (for example, the distance between a pair of points). For example, in terms of topology, a circle and a donut are indistinguishable.
  The concepts of homeomorphism and homotopy are very important for topology. Roughly speaking, these are types of deformation that occur without tearing and gluing. </p>
    <p> The following topology sections are distinguished:
      <ul> 
           <li> Algebraic topology </li>
           <li> Differential Topology </li>
           <li> Compute Topology </li>
     </ul>

    <p> <u>The problem of the four colors. </u> The problem is this: can any map be colored in four colors so that any two countries that have a common border are colored in different colors? The problem of the four colors is topological, since neither the shape of the countries nor the configuration of the borders matter.
The hypothesis that four colors are enough for this coloring of any map was first stated in 1852. And only in 1976 K. Appel and V. Haken from the University of Illinois, having spent more than 1000 hours of computer time, achieved success. </p>

<p>  <u> One-sided surfaces. </u> The simplest one-sided surface is a Mobius strip, named after A. Mobius, who discovered its extraordinary topological properties in 1858. Let ABCD be a rectangular strip of paper. If you glue point A to point B, and point C to point D, you get a ring with an inner surface, an outer surface and two edges. One side of the ring can be dyed. The painted surface will be bounded by the edges of the ring. The beetle can make a "trip around the world" around the ring, remaining either on a painted or unpainted surface. But if you twist the strip half a turn before gluing the ends and glue point A with point C, and B with D, you get a MÃ¶bius strip. This shape has only one surface and one edge. Any attempt to paint only one side of the Mobius strip is doomed to failure, since the Mobius strip has only one side. A beetle crawling in the middle of the Mobius leaf (without crossing the edges) will return to its original point in the upside down position. When cutting a Mobius leaf along the midline, it does not split into two. </p>
